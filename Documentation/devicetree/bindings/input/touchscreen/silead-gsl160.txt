* East Rising ER-TPC050 / Silead GSL1680 touchscreen controller

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "silead,gsl1680"
- reg: I2C address of the chip

these properties are required:
- interrupts: interrupt to which the chip is connected (also specify interrupt-parent)
- touch-gpio: a phandle to the touch event GPIO

Optional:
- pinctrl-0: a phandle to a pinmux object

Example:

	i2c@00000000 {
		/* configure GPIO1_14 as input and use this pin as interrupt source.
		   Also */
		touchscreen@40 {
			compatible = "silead,gsl1680";
			reg = <0x40>;
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&P8_16_pd>;
			wake-gpio = <&gpio1 14 0>;
			interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
			interrupts = <14 0>;
		};
