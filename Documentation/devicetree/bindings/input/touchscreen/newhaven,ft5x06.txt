* New Haven kt5x06 touchscreen controller

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "newhaven,kt5306"
- reg: I2C address of the chip

Either one of these properties is required:
- interrupts: interrupt to which the chip is connected (also specify interrupt-parent)
- touch-gpio: a phandle to the touch event GPIO

Optional:
- pinctrl-0: a phancle to a pinmux object

Example:

	i2c@00000000 {
		/* configure GPIO1_14 as input and use this pin as interrupt source.
		   Also */
		touchscreen@38 {
			compatible = "newhaven,kt5306";
			reg = <0x38>;
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&nh_ft5x06_pins>;
			touch-gpio = <&gpio1 14 0>;
		};

		/* use gpio1 irq 14 as interrupt source for touch events, 
		   the gpio must be already configured */
		touchscreen@38 {
			compatible = "newhaven,kt5306";
			reg = <0x38>;
			interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
			interrupts = <14 0>;
		};
